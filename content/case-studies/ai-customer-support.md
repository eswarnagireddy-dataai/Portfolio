# Case Study: AI-Driven Customer Support Transformation

## Part 1: The STAR Analysis

<div class="star-grid">
<div class="star-box">
<h3>Situation</h3>
Support volume tripled in six months, leading to 48-hour response times. Legacy systems provided zero visibility into voice calls, and manual authentication consumed 20% of agent time.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Task</h3>
Implement an intelligent support ecosystem to deflect routine queries, automate identity verification, and provide deep analytics for all voice interactions.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Action</h3>
I led a three-pillar strategy:
<ul>
<li><strong>RAG Chatbot:</strong> Answered 70% of routine inquiries using internal KB.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-Auth:</strong> Automated IVR identity checks before agents connected.</li>
<li><strong>Voice Analytics:</strong> STT pipeline to analyze sentiment and compliance.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Result</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>60% Reduction</strong> in research time.</li>
<li><strong>45% Deflection</strong> of support tickets.</li>
<li><strong>100% Visibility</strong> into customer sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>30% Efficiency</strong> gain in agent handling.</li>
</ul>

## Part 2: The Story: From Chaos to Insight

It was 9:00 AM on a Monday, and the support queue was already at 400 tickets. The team lead looked defeated. "We're not just answering questions," they told me. "We're searching for needles in haystacks every single time."

The problem wasn't just the volume; it was the **blindness**. Thousands of minutes of customer calls were sitting in a database, unsearched and unlearned from. Agents were spending the first three minutes of every call just proving the caller was who they said they were.

By implementing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system, we turned the company's disorganized PDF manuals into a living knowledge base. Instead of searching through files, agents—and eventually customers—could simply ask the AI.

Finally, we turned the lights on in the dark room of voice recordings. Using an offline Speech-to-Text pipeline, we discovered a recurring shipping glitch in the Midwest that had been invisible in manual logs for months.
