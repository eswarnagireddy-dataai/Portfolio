# Case Study: AI Root Cause Analysis for Automotive Manufacturing

## Part 1: The STAR Analysis

<div class="star-grid">
<div class="star-box">
<h3>Situation</h3>
Catastrophic delivery delays due to quality-check bottlenecks. Technicians spent <strong>6.5 hours per vehicle</strong> manually tracing sensor logs to find defects.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Task</h3>
Implement an intelligent Root Cause Analysis (RCA) system enabling shop floor employees to isolate defects instantly without senior engineering intervention.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Action</h3>
I architected a specialized AI platform:
<ul>
<li><strong>Pattern Matching:</strong> Anomaly detection trained on 5 years of failure signatures.</li>
<li><strong>Floor Interface:</strong> Ruggedized NL interface for immediate fix suggestions.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> Constant learning from manual corrections.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Result</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>85% Reduction</strong> in isolation time (6.5 hrs to 45 mins).</li>
<li><strong>20% Increase</strong> in daily assembly throughput.</li>
<li><strong>$1.2M Savings</strong> in annual overtime costs.</li>
</ul>

## Part 2: The Story: Empowering the Shop Floor

The breakthrough wasn't just the AI; it was the **Accessibility**. Traditionally, diagnostic data lived in complex databases that only data scientists could read. 

We brought that power to the person holding the wrench.

Previously, if a "Pressure Alert" went off, a worker would have to check 15 possible valves. Now, they scan the vehicle VIN, and the system tells them: *"92% Probability: Valve AC-4 is stuck open due to a gasket seal fault."*

By turning **Data into Directions**, we didn't just speed up the factory; we empowered the employees. The factory floor transition from "Searchers" to "Fixers" was the key to unlocking millions in hidden efficiency.
