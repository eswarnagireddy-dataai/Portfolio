# Case Study: Enterprise Data Strategy for E-Commerce

## Part 1: The STAR Analysis

<div class="star-grid">
<div class="star-box">
<h3>Situation</h3>
A high-growth D2C brand was scaling rapidly but flying blind. Marketing spend was spread across Meta, Google, and TikTok, while inventory was managed in a separate ERP. No unified view of LTV or CAC existed.

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Task</h3>
Implement a lean, high-impact data strategy to unify disparate data sources and provide real-time visibility into the metrics that matter for scaling a retail business.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Action</h3>
I designed a "Minimum Viable Data Stack":
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized Warehouse:</strong> Automated ingestion from Shopify, Meta, and GA4.</li>
<li><strong>Unified Attribution:</strong> Cross-channel engine to identify true conversion drivers.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory Bridge:</strong> Automatically pause ads for low-stock items.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Result</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>25% Improvement</strong> in Marketing ROI.</li>
<li><strong>18% Reduction</strong> in CAC.</li>
<li><strong>$200k Savings</strong> by preventing stockout ad spend.</li>
<li><strong>15 hrs/week</strong> saved for the finance team.</li>
</ul>

## Part 2: The Story: Simplicity Over Complexity

<div class="story-text">

The client didn't need a massive enterprise data lake; they needed answers to three questions: *Which ads are actually working? Which customers are worth scaling? And do we have enough stock to fulfill the demand?*

We ignored the complex "big data" hype and focused on **Data Connectivity**. 

By connecting their warehouse data to their marketing data, we discovered that they were spending $4,000 a week advertising a specific sneaker that was nearly out of stock. 

We implemented a simple "Automation Bridge": when stock fell below 10 units, the Meta Ad campaign was automatically suppressed. This one change alone paid for the entire data initiative within three weeks.
