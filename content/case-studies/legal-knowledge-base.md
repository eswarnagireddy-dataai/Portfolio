# Case Study: GenAI Knowledge Base for Legal Firm

## Part 1: The STAR Analysis

<div class="star-grid">
<div class="star-box">
<h3>Situation</h3>
120+ attorneys drowning in unstructured data. Associates spent <strong>4.5 hours per day</strong> researching precedents. Institutional knowledge was lost as partners retired.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Task</h3>
Implement an enterprise-grade GenAI knowledge base to centralize materials, enable natural language querying, and accelerate document drafting while ensuring 100% compliance.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Action</h3>
I led the secure RAG-powered deployment:
<ul>
<li><strong>Ingestion Pipeline:</strong> OCR & NLP processing for 500k+ documents.</li>
<li><strong>RAG Architecture:</strong> Citation-first system using fine-tuned legal LLMs.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Drafting:</strong> Co-pilot for auto-generating clauses and briefs.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Result</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>73% Reduction</strong> in research time (4.5 to 1.2 hrs).</li>
<li><strong>3.5x Faster</strong> contract drafting workflow.</li>
<li><strong>$2.4M Savings</strong> in redirected billable hours.</li>
<li><strong>100% Compliance</strong> with zero data breaches.</li>
</ul>

## Part 2: The Story: From Document Chaos to Legal Intelligence

<div class="story-split">
<div class="story-text">

Sarah, a third-year associate, had been searching for a specific indemnity clause for three hours. meanwhile, a filing deadline loomed. This wasn't just inefficiency—it was *institutional knowledge erosion*.

We started by building a **Legal Brain**—a vectorized knowledge graph of every document the firm had ever produced. But we knew accuracy alone wouldn't win trust. In legal practice, *explainability is everything*.

So we engineered a citation-first architecture. When an attorney asks a question, the system provides a synthesized response linked directly to source documents with highlighted passages.

Today, the firm's knowledge isn't just preserved; it's *activated*.
