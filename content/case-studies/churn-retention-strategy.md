# Case Study: Customer Churn Reduction & Personalized Retention

## Part 1: The STAR Analysis

### Situation
A global subscription-based SaaS platform was experiencing a "leaky bucket" problem. While new customer acquisition was strong, 12% of users were churning within the first 90 days. The platform's search functionality was basic, and product recommendations were generic, leading to a "disconnected" user experience where customers struggled to find value in the vast feature set.

### Task
Design and execute an end-to-end churn reduction strategy by transforming the user experience into a personalized journey, utilizing advanced search and AI-driven recommendations.

### Action
I led a comprehensive retention overhaul focused on three pillars:
- **Predictive Churn Modeling:** Developed a machine learning model to identify "at-risk" behavior (e.g., declining login frequency, decreased feature usage) 14 days before a potential cancellation.
- **Intelligent Search & Discovery:** Replaced the legacy keyword search with a semantic search engine, allowing users to find tools based on "intent" rather than just tags.
- **Hyper-Personalized Recommendation Engine:** Implemented a collaborative filtering system that suggested features and workflows based on a user's industry and successful patterns from similar "Power Users."
- **Triggered Retention Campaigns:** Integrated the churn model with the CRM to trigger "Save Offers" and personalized tutorial content specifically addressing the user's friction points.

### Result
- **18% Reduction** in overall churn within 6 months.
- **24% Increase** in user engagement (session duration) through personalized discovery.
- **35% Conversion** on retention-triggered "Help" invites vs the previous 5% on generic emails.
- **$1.8M Recovery** in annual recurring revenue (ARR) directly attributed to the churn intervention.

## Part 2: The Story: Making the Platform "Self-Aware"

Most companies treat churn as a marketing problem. We treated it as a **Search and Relevance** problem. 

<blockquote>
"If a user can't find what they need in the first 3 minutes, they aren't just confused—they are churning."
</blockquote>

We realized that users weren't leaving because the platform lacked features; they were leaving because they were overwhelmed by the *wrong* features. By implementing an AI-driven Recommendation Engine, we turned the platform into a personal consultant.

If a user was a Marketing Manager, the dashboard now highlighted campaign tools and hidden analytics features used by Top 1% Marketing Managers. If they were in Legal, it surfaced compliance logs. 

Through **Personalization**, we didn't just stop people from leaving; we showed them the path to becoming a Power User. The result wasn't just higher retention—it was a 15% increase in customer acquisition through word-of-mouth as users finally "unlocked" the platform's true potential.
