## Part 1: The STAR Analysis

<div class="star-grid">
<div class="star-box">
<h3>Situation</h3>
A leaky bucket problem: 12% of users churned within 90 days. Search was basic and recommendations were generic, leading to a disconnected user experience.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Task</h3>
Design a churn reduction strategy by transforming the user experience into a personalized journey using semantic search and AI-driven recommendations.
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Action</h3>
I led a three-pillar retention overhaul:
<ul>
<li><strong>Predictive Modeling:</strong> Identified at-risk behavior 14 days before cancellation.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Search:</strong> Semantic engine for intent-based discovery.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Engine:</strong> Collaborative filtering for workflow suggestions.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="star-box">
<h3>Result</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>18% Reduction</strong> in overall churn.</li>
<li><strong>24% Increase</strong> in user engagement.</li>

## Part 2: The Story: Making the Platform "Self-Aware"

<div class="story-text">

Most companies treat churn as a marketing problem. We treated it as a **Search and Relevance** problem. 

<blockquote>
"If a user can't find what they need in the first 3 minutes, they aren't just confused—they are churning."
</blockquote>

We realized that users weren't leaving because the platform lacked features; they were leaving because they were overwhelmed by the *wrong* features. By implementing an AI-driven Recommendation Engine, we turned the platform into a personal consultant. 

If a user was a Marketing Manager, the dashboard now highlighted campaign tools used by the Top 1%. If they were in Legal, it surfaced compliance logs. 

Through **Personalization**, we didn't just stop people from leaving; we showed them the path to becoming a Power User.
